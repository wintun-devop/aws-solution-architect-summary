### VPC Reachability Analyzer vs VPC Network Access Analyzer
- VPC Reachability Analyzer is a configuration analysis tool that allows you to test connectivity between a source and destination 
   resource in your VPCs. If the destination is reachable, it provides hop-by-hop details of the network path. If it's not reachable, it identifies the blocking component, such as security groups, network ACLs, or route tables.
- VPC Network Access Analyzer helps you identify unintended network access to your AWS resources.You can define your network access 
   requirements and use the tool to detect potential paths that do not meet your specified rules
- Key difference is that Reachability Analyzer focuses on troubleshooting specific connectivity issues, while Network Access Analyzer is more 
  about governing and validating network access across your environment.
