- Networking service that improves the availability and performance of applications running in multiple AWS Regions.
- Latency Reduction for Global Applications – It routes traffic through the AWS global network, reducing latency for applications like gaming, 
  media streaming, and financial services.
- Disaster Recovery & Multi-Region Resiliency – If an application endpoint fails, Global Accelerator automatically redirects traffic to the 
  next available AWS Region.
- Security & DDoS Protection – It masks the origin of applications behind static IP addresses, reducing exposure to attacks.
- Blue/Green Deployments & A/B Testing – Allows seamless traffic shifting between different versions of an application without updating client 
  configurations.
- IoT & Retail Applications – Useful for applications where frequent client updates are impractical, such as IoT devices and retail platforms.
