  - Object Lock
    - Prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.  
    - meet regulatory requirements that require write-once-read-many (WORM) storage or to simply add another layer of protection against 
      object changes and deletions.
    - two ways to manage object retention
      - Retention period
      - Legal hold
      - Retention modes
        - Compliance mode
          - A protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account.
          - Retention mode can't be changed, and its retention period can't be shortened.
          - Helps ensure that an object version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention period.
        - Governance mode
          - users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions.
          - 
    - Object Lock works only in buckets that have S3 Versioning enabled.
