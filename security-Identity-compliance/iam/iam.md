### Monitoring and Logging
- IAM Access Analyzer
  - External Access Analysis
    - Identifies resources in your AWS account or organization that are shared with external entities.
    - Generates findings when a resource-based policy grants access to a principal outside your zone of trust.
    - helps us to detect unintended access and potential security risks.
  - Unused Access Analysis
    - Focuses on identifying IAM roles, user credentials, and permissions that have not been used within a specified time frame.
    - Helps us clean up unnecessary access, reducing security risks and improving compliance.
