- Homogeneous Data Ingestion
 - All data sources share similar formats, structures, and technologies.
 - Simplified integration – Since all data follows the same standards, ingestion pipelines are straightforward.
 - Standardized formats – Data usually comes in uniform file types (CSV, JSON, databases, etc.).
 - Optimized performance – Less need for data transformation or conversion.
 - Faster processing – Data ingestion tools can be tightly coupled with the system, reducing latency.

- Heterogeneous Data Ingestion
 - Data sources vary widely in format, structure, and technology.
 - Complex integration – Different protocols, APIs, and formats need to be reconciled.
 - Data transformation – ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes play a crucial role in standardizing diverse data.
 - Interoperability challenges – Bridging structured and unstructured data requires robust middleware or connectors.
 - Scalability considerations – Ingesting varied data types demands adaptive architecture and flexible workflows.
